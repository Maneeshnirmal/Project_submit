The build of maven is already formed and the output is in .war format so here it changes to tomcat output.

#install tomcat

FROM tomcat:9.0
# use copy directive to copy war image to host 
COPY app.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/

#run the tomcat script
#"Catalina" is the script that is actually responsible for starting and stoping Tomcat
CMD ["catalina.sh", "run"]

# build the image
docker build -t my-tomcat-app .

# run the code

docker run -dt --name my-tomcat-container -p 8080:8080 my-tomcat-app
